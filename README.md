# Face-Emotion-Recognition
Welcome to the Face Emotion Recognition project! This repository contains a Python-based implementation for detecting and recognizing human emotions from facial expressions using deep learning techniques. The project leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and pre-trained models to achieve high accuracy in emotion classification.
