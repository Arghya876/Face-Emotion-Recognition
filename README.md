# Face-Emotion-Recognition
# Overview
Welcome to the Face Emotion Recognition project! This repository contains a Python-based implementation for detecting and recognizing human emotions from facial expressions using deep learning techniques. The project leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and pre-trained models to achieve high accuracy in emotion classification.

# Features
**Real-time Emotion Detection:** Analyze emotions from live video streams or pre-recorded videos.<br>
**Image Emotion Analysis:** Detect emotions in static images.<br>
**Multi-Emotion Classification:** Recognize a wide range of emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, fear, disgust, and neutrality.<br>
**User-Friendly Interface:** Simple command-line interface for running the application.<br>
**Modular Codebase:** Well-structured code for easy customization and extension.<br>
