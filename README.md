# Face-Emotion-Recognition
# Overview
Welcome to the Face Emotion Recognition project! This repository contains a Python-based implementation for detecting and recognizing human emotions from facial expressions using deep learning techniques. The project leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and pre-trained models to achieve high accuracy in emotion classification.

# Features
- **Real-time Emotion Detection:** Analyze emotions from live video streams or pre-recorded videos.<br>
- **Image Emotion Analysis:** Detect emotions in static images.<br>
- **Multi-Emotion Classification:** Recognize a wide range of emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, fear, disgust, and neutrality.<br>
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple command-line interface for running the application.<br>
- **Modular Codebase:** Well-structured code for easy customization and extension.<br>

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **OpenCV**: Library for computer vision tasks such as capturing video frames and image processing.
- **TensorFlow / Keras**: Deep learning framework used for building and training the emotion recognition model.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation library for managing datasets.

## Project Structure

- `models/`: Directory containing pre-trained models and scripts for model training.
